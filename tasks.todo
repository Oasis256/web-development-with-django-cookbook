Knowledge:
 ☐ Second Edition: January 2016
 ☐


Chapter 1:
 ☐ I had to change to django==1.8.6 I got an error on 1.8.1 in the migration
     ✔ for base in inspect.getmro(new_class) @done (16-06-30 22:55)
     ✔ AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'getmro' @done (16-06-30 22:56)
 ☐ The way they layout their Project is too verbose or too long. It's good for Legacy project but for project with one app I don't think I need all that.
 ☐ I like the fact that they have manies 'requirements' and 'conf'
 ☐ Actually, I like the name 'conf' but I still prefer the name 'settings' that I usually adopt in my project.
 ✔ I'm still confuse with the python 2 ('u,'b) compatibility I don't have python 2 installed on my  local machine @done (16-06-30 22:56)
 ☐ I installed Anaconda (python2) and redid the chapter 1 and it works great
 ☐ They use a Signals on their app each time an object is save or delete. I like it. But I prefer to use the __logger__ to log the information instead of printing it.
 ☐ I'm not that into their way to set the static url... it's nice but I need to try it in other project to see if it really worth it
 ☐ shell:
   ☐ import os
   ☐ STATIC_ULR = from utils.misc import get_git_changeset(os.getcwd())
 ☐ p.33 I think that overwritting app settings might be tricky to debug. I tend to add my settings in the settings.py not in a file i.e. views.py
 ☐ models.py I like the way that they already set the fields name of the Models for translation


 Chapter 2:
  ☐ They always define an apps.py in their APPS
  ☐ p.45 I didn't quite understand the __contenttypes__
  ☐ Also they load the apps.py with __init__.py
  ☐ Utils/
  ☐ I really like their models.py mixin for __URLs__
  ☐ The metatags mixin are Genious I'm wondering if django-meta or django-seo have those mixins
  ☐ I had to put some relative import into myproject/conf/dev.py
  ☐ They should I put the modification of the example in Bold p52 but others no
  ☐ This project is still a python2 based 'ImportError: No module named 'urlparse'' in python 3 is urllib.parse that's why I'm using instead Anaconda Continuum (python 2)
  ☐ I prefer to use django-rosetta instead of the Multilingual Mixin

chapter 3:
 ☐ I like the way they rendering the template in the urls.py in email_messages apps __'django.shortcuts.render', {'template_name': "email_messages/message_to_user_done.html"}, name="message_to_user_done"),__
 ☐ Chapter3 has a lot of errors in python3 from 'urlparse', to relative_path (.models),
 ☐ I like the fact they are tranlating every 'label' (forms.py) and fields 'models.py'
 ☐ Interesting it's the first time that I see a **save()** method in a Contact form to send email. And they are right the view looks cleaner. I need to adopt that approach
 ☐ fail silently suppose to be in the brackets
 ☐ For the Quotes app I prefer to use a django-package instead of PIL to generate thumbnail
 ☐ models.py I didn't know that we can create a function for __upload_to__
 ☐ When I save forms  in the view I need to pass the files attributes also **InspirationalQuoteForm(data=request.POST, files=request.FILES) ***
 ☐ Bulletin Board.models is a great example of how to use django-crispy-forms (image pg. 97)
 ☐ Their Search Facets seams great but I didn't fully understand the template part
 ☐ I never render a **PDF** with html templates
 ☐ I didn't know that I could use django-haystack with Whoosh p.109 offers a great example. I think I might use it for ottawacityjobs and use the search form box as a 'include'
 ☐ The whoosh implementation seems to magical to me. I need to redo it twice to make sure that I do understand
 ☐ bulletin_boards/forms.py I like the fact that they use _ for translating in the future the Form label
 ☐ I added in screenshot/ch-3/ the bulletin_boards/forms.py result I like it! It's genius
 ☐ I also like their login view too in myproject/urls.py I'm wondering if we can do that with python-social-auth
 ☐ how did they get the title 'My Website'???
 ☐ I think they had 'My Website' because the myproject/urls.py //login implies the templates/base.html file -------------NO-NO Django looks at templates/registration/login.html
 ☐ The way they use the filter for /movies is Genius!! I need to use it for another project
 ☐ The chapter 3 is really long... to do. it's almost 60 pages
 ☐ I skip the render to pdf I have no project in mind where I can use it.
 ☐ The Whoosh/Haystack indexing are Genius!!! I need to implement the __search__ app in another project
 ☐ for the search in myproject/urls.py they use a __class__ for the CrispyformHelper


chapter 4:
 ☐ ??? they increase their version of django to 1.8.7??? lol!
 ☐
